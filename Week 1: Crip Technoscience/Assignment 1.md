Conducting literature search      
    
        
        

### Aim
The aim of the first assignment was to practise conducting a preliminary online search of relevant material following the choosing of an area of focus. Further, we were to document the process of searching and collecting relevant material using strategies laid out in the book: Newing, H. (2010). Conducting Research in Conservation: Social Science Methods and Practice. United Kingdom: Taylor & Francis.    


Identifying a Research Topic    
The first thing I considered when trying to identify a research topic was positionality. As a person with a history of the learning disability ADHD through my middle school years, I decided it 
would be best for me to conduct research along the lines. Recollecting from personal memory, I decided an interesting avenue of research would be to conduct a study on how ADHD affects children 
middle school (ages 9-13)
